# TorCommander - The Toralizer

## Overview

**TorCommander** is a Linux-based tool designed to enhance anonymity by routing system commands through the **Tor network**. It allows users to execute commands securely while hiding their IP and location.

This project was inspired by **Dr. Jones Birch**, a YouTuber who explores cybersecurity and anonymity topics. We have expanded on the idea, making it open-source and accessible for further development.

## Features

- **Tor Integration:** Routes commands through the Tor network for enhanced privacy.
- **Command Toralization:** Converts standard Linux commands into Tor network clients using the `toralize` keyword.
- **Geolocation Masking:** Ensures that the user's IP and location remain hidden.
- **Modular Design:** Consists of core files (`toralize.c`, `toralize.h`, `Makefile`) for easy compilation and integration.
- **Open-Source & Community-Driven:** Anyone can contribute to improve and expand the project.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- **Tor**: Make sure the Tor service is installed and running on your system.
- **GCC**: The GNU Compiler Collection for compiling C programs.
- **Make**: For building the project using the `Makefile`.

You can install these dependencies on most Linux distributions by running the following:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tor gcc make

Steps

    Clone the Repository:

    Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/torcommander.git
cd torcommander

Compile the Source Code:

Use the make command to compile the project:

make

Start the Tor Service (if not running):

Make sure the Tor service is running. You can start it with:

sudo systemctl start tor

Set Up toralize Globally:

To access the toralize command from anywhere in your terminal, copy it to /usr/bin/:

sudo cp toralize /usr/bin/

(Note: The preload configuration for toralize will be updated soon.)

Execute Commands Anonymously:

Once the setup is complete, you can start using the tool to execute commands through Tor by typing:

toralize <command>

Example:

    toralize curl ifconfig.me

    This will display your IP address routed through the Tor network, ensuring your real IP is hidden.

Example Usage

To check your current IP address through Tor, run:

toralize curl ifconfig.me

To download a file anonymously via HTTP using wget, run:

toralize wget http://example.com/file.zip

How It Works

    The toralize command intercepts the system command input and reroutes it through the Tor network.

    The modified request is sent through the Tor network via a randomly selected Tor exit node, masking the user's IP and location.

    The response from the server is received through the same Tor circuit and displayed, ensuring no direct connection to your real IP.

Security Considerations

    Tor Configuration: Ensure that your Tor service is properly configured and running. Some configurations may restrict exit node functionality.

    Service Blocking: Some websites and services may block or restrict traffic originating from Tor exit nodes. This can cause some commands (like browsing or downloading) to fail.

    Encryption: While Tor hides your IP address, it does not encrypt the traffic between your computer and the destination. You may want to use additional encryption (e.g., HTTPS) when working with sensitive data.
