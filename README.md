TorCommander - The Toralizer
Overview

TorCommander is a Linux-based tool designed to enhance anonymity by routing system commands through the Tor network. It allows users to execute commands securely while hiding their IP and location.

This project was inspired by Dr. Jones Birch, a YouTuber who explores cybersecurity and anonymity topics. We have expanded on the idea, making it open-source and accessible for further development.
Features

    Tor Integration: Routes commands through the Tor network for enhanced privacy.

    Command Toralization: Converts standard Linux commands into Tor network clients using the toralize keyword.

    Geolocation Masking: Ensures that the user's IP and location remain hidden.

    Modular Design: Consists of core files (toralize.c, toralize.h, Makefile) for easy compilation and integration.

    Open-Source & Community-Driven: Anyone can contribute to improve and expand the project.

Installation
Prerequisites

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

    Tor

    GCC (for compiling C programs)

Steps

    Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/torcommander.git  
cd torcommander

Compile the Source Code:

make

Start Tor Service (if not running):

sudo systemctl start tor

Set Up toralize Globally:
To access toralize from anywhere, move it to /usr/bin/ and set it up for preloading:

sudo cp toralize /usr/bin/  

(Note: The preload configuration for toralize will be updated soon.)

Execute Commands Anonymously:

    toralize <command>

Example Usage

To check your current IP through Tor:

toralize curl ifconfig.me

To download a file anonymously:

toralize wget http://example.com/file.zip

How It Works

    The toralize command intercepts the input and routes it through the Tor network.

    The modified request is then sent via an anonymized Tor circuit.

    The response is received and displayed without exposing the original IP address.

Security Considerations

    Ensure Tor is properly configured before use.

    Some services may block Tor exit nodes, limiting functionality.

    Avoid using toralize for sensitive operations without additional encryption layers.
