## Overview

**TorCommander** is a lightweight, Linux-based tool that routes system-level commands through the [Tor Network](https://www.torproject.org/) for anonymized execution. With a simple `toralize` keyword, users can mask their IP address and geolocation while executing common networking and system commands. Ideal for developers, researchers, and privacy-focused users, the tool encourages safe and censorship-resistant usage.

Inspired by cybersecurity advocate **Dr. Jones Birch**, TorCommander brings the power of anonymity into a Unix shell in a developer-friendly way. Fully open-source and community-driven.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### üìÖ Prerequisites

Install required tools:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tor gcc make
```

### ‚öô Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/torcommander.git
   cd torcommander
   ```

2. Compile the source code:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Copy the `toralize` script to `/usr/bin` for global access:
   ```bash
   sudo cp toralize /usr/bin/
   sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/toralize
   ```

4. Ensure Tor is running:
   ```bash
   sudo service tor start
   ```

## üîß Usage

Use `toralize` as a prefix to any command you want to route through Tor:

```bash
toralize curl ifconfig.me
```

> If you run into issues, try resolving explicitly:
> ```bash
> toralize curl --resolve http://example.com
> ```

---

## üîç Example Commands That Work

- `toralize curl https://example.com`
- `toralize ping onion-site.onion`
- `toralize wget http://mirror.site`
- `toralize ssh user@hostname`
- `toralize git clone https://github.com/...`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility depends on how the app resolves network calls (SOCKS4 support).
